    name: "Steve Conzo",
    movie: "Jurassic Park",
    poster: "./images/steveconzo.jpg",
    description: "Outside from being one of the most enthusiastic people I know, Steve's also a fellow-Brand New fan. It wasn't but a month ago we both founds ourselves in Cooperstown, NY at the Ommegang Brewery catching Brand New, Manchester Orchestra, and Kevin Devine.",
    description2: "Sitting on the lawn of the Ommegang Brewery, overlooking a crowd of some 10,000 as the sun began setting, I looked over to Steve and damn near kissed the son of a bitch. Our eyes connected, our hands clasped one another around our burrito, and without taking my eyes off his, I asked him: Will you do my podcast?",
    description3: "To a resounding yes, we both took a lasting bite of opposite ends of our Gooch. Lady and the Tramp style. I mean, it was just beautiful.",

    name: "Mary Jennings",
    movie: "House of the Devil",
    poster: "./images/maryjennings.jpg",
    description: "Mary Jennings is an amazingly talented, beautifully kind-hearted singer songwriter out of Nashville, TN. Not only is she just one of the most pleasant humans I've had the pleasure of knowing during her time in New York, but she's also the most enterprising of people.",
    description2: "Whether it be putting on clothing swap drives for charity, volunteering at Habitat for Humanity, or starting her own apparel company, No Sass, designing and selling handmade bolo-ties and other accessories, Mary's personality and character shines through her art.",
    description3: "For as kind as Mary is, she's also a tough cookie. She happens to also be the type of person who makes a dangerous sangria, but it's for the first reason that I thought she'd make a great guest.",

  {
    name: "Rachel Epp",
    movie: "Star Wars",
    poster: "./images/rachelepp.jpg",
    description: "It was only a matter of time before I had Rachel Epp on for the Podcast. She's actually been on a few times, you can hear her in the background usually in the middle of vacating the recording studio (aka - our living room) so that the guest and I can be undisturbed as we engage deeply into our feelings towards that episode's selected movie.",
    description2: "Lo' the inevitability of her appearance on the podcast should come sooner than later, and what better time than when I have to return Glen's Blu-Ray DVD Star Wars set? I'm sure you will come to see, as much as she is obviously disinterested in the movie, she is inescapably invested and feels the incessant need to comment, question, probe, question again, then comment once more on the goings on of the movie.",
    description3: "It's one of the reasons why I love her.",

  {
    name: "Jordan Hudock",
    movie: "Annie Hall",
    poster: "./images/jordanhudock.jpg",
    description: "A tall, slender man with tightly wound curly hair, and an almost always (at least, as I fondly recall) slight grin. He can found in the Music Biography section of your local Barnes and Noble, even at the insistence that he read local - c'mon Jor! His name is Jordan Hudock, and he rocks.",
    description2: "I remember walking into Jordan's living room for the first and being faced with a large bookshelf stocked with the musical biographies like that of Elvis Costello, John Lennon, and David Bowie. I complimented him on the variety and wished I had taken the time to learn more about my favorite musicians. He humbly insisted those were his wife's books (she rocks too).",
    description3: "To this day, I still can't tell whose books they are because both Jordan and his wife, Vivien, are exceptionally sweet people who share an array of interests in the world of art, music, literature, and movies. This movie included.",

  {
    name: "Candice Ruud",
    movie: "The Sound of Music",
    poster: "./images/candiceruud.jpg",
    description: "I don't even know where to begin with Candice. There's an overgrown ivy patch of history between her and I that dates back to high school in Texas, but I won't bore you with the details. Basically, we were like silent ships passing in the night as I move TO the Lone Star State, and she moved FROM it. All I knew of her was that she had a reputation for being spontaneous, outrageous, and fun.",
    description2: "Turns out, that's all true and more. Candice is a fierce person. She's smart, sharp, and blunt at times. You know, the type of friend that on more than one occasion, will make you have to vacate a room because of a sidebar comment made a bit too loudly in the presence of the person said comment was about.",
    description3: "Having transplanted to New York by way of Oregon, Candice is still insistent on retaining Pacific North West hospitality. She'll knock you if you opt for an umbrella and not a raincoat, or if you order your whiskey on the rocks. But she's a real softy when it comes to this movie.",

    name: "Dan Munkus",
    movie: "The Dark Knight",
    poster: "./images/danmunkus.jpg",
    description: "One of the earliest times I spent with Dan, he had invited me to a Junip concert at the High Line Ballroom in New York City.  At that time, I'd only known Dan briefly, though he and Rachel were friends going on 6 or 7 years. My first reaction to his inquiry as to my going was confusion. Are we 'there' yet? After all, how well could you know someone if you haven't watched The Fellowship of the Ring together?",
    description2: "I don't even know Dan's middle name. I just didn't want things to move too fast. I just wanted to enjoy the honeymoon phase. That was until I found out that Dan rocks. Back when I started the podcast, I had begun the conversation with Dan about recording an episode. After much procrastination, we picked up the conversation and settled on TDK, to which I then immediately I said 'conversation over.'",
    description3: "I quickly evacuated our talk so as to avoid spoiling what I knew was going to be a plentiful conversation - for me, anyways. So, there you have it. Enjoy. Also, check out Dan's record label, Subtle Soup.",
